								<p>Liesel said she had a Christmas gift for me. She took me to my father’s shop, and I tried on a few suits, finally settling on a nice navy blue suit. In a way, Liesel was giving it to me on behalf of my father, whom I miss so badly. It was a beautiful gesture.</p>

								<p>Today, while avoiding Franz Deutscher, my former tyrannical Hitler Youth leader, we ran into an even greater tyrant. It was Viktor Chemmel, the new leader of the gang of thieves Liesel and I used to be a part of. The bastard stole Liesel’s book, The Whistler, and flung it into the Amper River.</p>
								<p>Fortunately, I acted quickly. I ran straight to the river, tore off my clothes, and swam to the book as fast as I could. After months of failing in every way imaginable, it feels great to savour a victory like this.</p>
								<p>One thing bothers me. After I ran into the ice-cold water to rescue her book, she still refused to kiss me. Will it ever happen?</p>
