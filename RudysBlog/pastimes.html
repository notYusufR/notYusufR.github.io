								<p>While playing soccer on the street, Klaus Behrig collided with Liesel, injuring Liesel’s knee. Liesel asked me to call Herr Hubermann, which I did. He took her inside.</p>
                                <p>I went to check on her some time later and although her injury was fine, she was acting very worried. It seems the stealing has gotten to her.</p>

								<p>Yesterday, a Black American runner named Jesse Owens won his fourth gold medal in this year’s Olympics. At night, when no one was looking, I coated myself in black with charcoal and snuck out of the house. I biked down to Hubert Oval and ran his race, the 4 x 100m relay.</p>
								<p>The crowd was roaring my name. I was Jesse Owens. I was Jesse Owens in every stride I took of that race - until my dad showed up. For some reason, he seemed less upset that I had snuck out to run, and more upset about the charcoal smeared on my face. He said something about how I was lucky to be German, and not black or Jewish. What’s wrong with being black or Jewish?</p>
